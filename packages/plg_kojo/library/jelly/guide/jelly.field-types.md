# Jelly Field Types

Jelly comes with many common field types defined as objects with suitable
logic for retrieving and formatting them for the database.

For now, you can see the [API docs](api/Jelly_Field) for more details about
all the field types included and their properties

## Custom fields

Since field objects in Jelly manage almost every aspect of setting and getting
data for that model property, you can achieve powerful and custom model
behavior by [extending the basic field types](jelly.extending-field).
